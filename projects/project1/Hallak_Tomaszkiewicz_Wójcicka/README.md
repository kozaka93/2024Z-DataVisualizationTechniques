## It's all about mental health!
The poster focuses on analyzing the six dimensions of mental health through the lens of the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ). It explains that mental wellbeing is the ability to manage life’s stresses and challenges, emphasizing that MHQ is not a measure of happiness but rather a snapshot of self-perception across various mental health dimensions. 
The poster highlights correlations such as the impact of a positive household atmosphere during childhood and the number of close friendships on mental health, while also emphasizing the role of education.
