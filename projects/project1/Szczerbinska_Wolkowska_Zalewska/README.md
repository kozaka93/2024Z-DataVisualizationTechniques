This repository contains all project files used and created by the team consisting of Hanna Szczerbińska, Paula Wołkowska and Zuzanna Zalewska, in connection with our first project in the course 'Data Visualization Techniques' at Warsaw University of Technology, during the 2024/2025 winter semester. Our poster focuses on different aspects of drug abuse, ranging from the location-based differences in drug-related mortality rates in Europe, to the people most likely to abuse various drugs and the exact effects on their health.
