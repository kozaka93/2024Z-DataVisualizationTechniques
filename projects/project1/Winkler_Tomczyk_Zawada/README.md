## Will you (not) marry me? Correlation between marriege/divorce and mental health issues.

Our poster focuses on how mental health is affected by divorce. We chose this topic because we noticed a growing problem in the immediate environment and were surprised by the European-wide research on this topic. As a result of your research and the presentation of it on the poster, we noticed that more frequent mental illness is closely linked to the increasing determinant of divorce.
